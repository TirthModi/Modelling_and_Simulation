# 🧮 Modelling and Simulation (CS302) – Laboratory Work and Reports

The course focused on the application of **analytical** and **numerical techniques** to model and simulate a wide range of real-world systems across disciplines such as economics, biology, ecology, public health, and strategic studies. Emphasis was placed on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using real-world datasets and simulation methodologies.
